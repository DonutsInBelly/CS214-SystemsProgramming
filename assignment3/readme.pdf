So far, all we've implemented is the base program which allows a client to open, read, write and close files on our file server.

For the server, run "make testserver" which gives you an executable: testserver.o
Please run ./testserver.o on cd.cs.rutgers.edu before the client.

For the client, run "make" or "make libnetfiles"
The executable is called libnet.o
libnet.o tests all the functions.

To remove the executables, run "make clean"
