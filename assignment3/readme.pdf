So far, all we've implemented is the base program which allows a client to open, read, write and close files on our file server.

Run "make"
First, run the server "./netfileserver.o" on cd.cs.rutgers.edu
The client executable is called libnet.o
"./libnet.o" is the client

To remove the executables, run "make clean"
