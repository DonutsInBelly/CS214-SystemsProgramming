tests to run:

error handling:
-file does not exist
-file is empty
-input parameters don't match expected
    missing number of parts
    file is not in form filename.txt
-input file of just single characters (so expected output would be same as input)
-total number of characters is not divisible by number of parts
-number of parts is greater than total number of characters

edge cases:
-a run of 2 is split
  ex: aaabbccddde (11 characters divided into 2 parts, expected output: 3a2bc and c3de)
-very large (over 2000 characters long) input
-program is shut down unexpectedly
-non-alpha characters
